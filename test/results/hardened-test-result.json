GRUB\n2 is the default boot loader for RHEL 7 and is designed to require a password\nto boot into single-user mode or make modifications to the boot menu.\n    The GRUB 2 superuser account is an account of last resort. Establishing a\nunique username for this account hardens the boot loader against brute force\nattacks. Due to the nature of the superuser account database being distinct\nfrom the OS account database, this allows the use of a username that is not\namong those within the OS account database. Examples of non-unique superusers\nnames are root, superuser, unlock, etc.\n  \"\n  desc  'rationale', ''\n  desc  'check', \"\n    For systems that use UEFI, this is Not Applicable.\n\n    For systems that are running a version of RHEL prior to 7.2, this is Not\nApplicable.\n\n    Verify that a unique name is set as the \\\"superusers\\\" account:\n\n    # grep -iw \\\"superusers\\\" /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n        set superusers=\\\"[someuniquestringhere]\\\"\n        export superusers\n\n    If \\\"superusers\\\" is identical to any OS account name or is missing a name,\nthis is a finding.\n  \"\n  desc  'fix', \"\n    Configure the system to have a unique name for the grub superusers account.\n\n    Edit the /boot/grub2/grub.cfg file and add or modify the following lines in\nthe \\\"### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/01_users ###\\\" section:\n\n    set superusers=\\\"[someuniquestringhere]\\\"\n    export superusers\n    password_pbkdf2 [someuniquestringhere] ${GRUB2_PASSWORD}\n  \"\n  impact 0.5\n  tag severity: 'medium'\n  tag gtitle: 'SRG-OS-000080-GPOS-00048'\n  tag gid: 'V-244557'\n  tag rid: 'SV-244557r792838_rule'\n  tag stig_id: 'RHEL-07-010483'\n  tag fix_id: 'F-47789r744062_fix'\n  tag cci: ['CCI-000213']\n  tag nist: ['AC-3']\nend\n","source_location":{"line":3,"ref":"/Users/wdower/work/sd/redhat-enterprise-linux-7-stig-baseline/controls/SV-244557.rb"},"waiver_data":{},"results":[]},{"id":"SV-204548","title":"The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must audit all uses of\nthe sudo command.","desc":"Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible\nif audit records do not contain enough information.\n\n    At a minimum, the organization must audit the full-text recording of\nprivileged access commands.

GRUB\n2 is the default boot loader for RHEL 7 and is designed to require a password\nto boot into single-user mode or make modifications to the boot menu.\n    The GRUB 2 superuser account is an account of last resort. Establishing a\nunique username for this account hardens the boot loader against brute force\nattacks. Due to the nature of the superuser account database being distinct\nfrom the OS account database, this allows the use of a username that is not\namong those within the OS account database. Examples of non-unique superusers\nnames are root, superuser, unlock, etc.\n  \"\n  desc  'rationale', ''\n  desc  'check', \"\n    For systems that use BIOS, this is Not Applicable.\n\n    For systems that are running a version of RHEL prior to 7.2, this is Not\nApplicable.\n\n    Verify that a unique name is set as the \\\"superusers\\\" account:\n\n    $ sudo grep -iw \\\"superusers\\\" /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg\n        set superusers=\\\"[someuniquestringhere]\\\"\n        export superusers\n\n    If \\\"superusers\\\" is identical to any OS account name or is missing a name,\nthis is a finding.\n  \"\n  desc  'fix', \"\n    Configure the system to have a unique name for the grub superusers account.\n\n    Edit the /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg file and add or modify the following\nlines in the \\\"### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/01_users ###\\\" section:\n\n    set superusers=\\\"[someuniquestringhere]\\\"\n    export superusers\n    password_pbkdf2 [someuniquestringhere] ${GRUB2_PASSWORD}\n  \"\n  impact 0.5\n  tag severity: 'medium'\n  tag gtitle: 'SRG-OS-000080-GPOS-00048'\n  tag gid: 'V-244558'\n  tag rid: 'SV-244558r792840_rule'\n  tag stig_id: 'RHEL-07-010492'\n  tag fix_id: 'F-47790r744065_fix'\n  tag cci: ['CCI-000213']\n  tag nist: ['AC-3']\nend\n","source_location":{"line":3,"ref":"/Users/wdower/work/sd/redhat-enterprise-linux-7-stig-baseline/controls/SV-244558.rb"},"waiver_data":{},"results":[]},{"id":"SV-204594","title":"The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so\nthat the SSH daemon is configured to only use the SSHv2 protocol.","desc":"SSHv1 is an insecure implementation of the SSH protocol and has many\nwell-known vulnerability exploits.
