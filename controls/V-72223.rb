  title "All network connections associated with a communication session must
be terminated at the end of the session or after 10 minutes of inactivity from
the user at a command prompt, except to fulfill documented and validated
mission requirements."
  desc  "
    Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window
of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management
session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended.
In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources
committed by the managed network element.

    Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions
includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at
the operating system level and de-allocating networking assignments at the
application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating
system-level network connection. This does not mean that the operating system
terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session
and releases the resources associated with that session.
