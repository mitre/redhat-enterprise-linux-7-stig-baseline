Note: AIDE is highly configurable at install time. These commands assume the "aide.conf" file is under the "/etc" directory.

Use the following command to determine if the file is in another location:

Check the "aide.conf" file to determine if the "xattrs" rule has been added to the rule list being applied to the files and directories selection lists.

An example rule that includes the "xattrs" rule follows:

     All= p+i+n+u+g+s+m+S+sha512+acl+xattrs+selinux
     /bin All # apply the custom rule to the files in bin 
     /sbin All # apply the same custom rule to the files in sbin 

If the "xattrs" rule is not being used on all uncommented selection lines in the "/etc/aide.conf" file, or extended attributes are not being checked by another file integrity tool, this is a finding.'
