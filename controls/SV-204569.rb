  title "The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must audit all uses of
the rename syscall."
  desc  "If the system is not configured to audit certain activities and write
them to an audit log, it is more difficult to detect and track system
compromises and damages incurred during a system compromise.

    When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account that is
being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to
-1. The auid representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals
4294967295. The audit system interprets -1, 4294967295, and \"unset\" in the
same way.


  "
  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    Verify the operating system generates audit records when
successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the \"rename\" syscall occur.

    Check the file system rules in \"/etc/audit/audit.rules\" with the
following commands:

    # grep -iw rename /etc/audit/audit.rules

    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S rename -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k delete

    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S rename -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k delete

    If both the \"b32\" and \"b64\" audit rules are not defined for the
\"rename\" syscall, this is a finding.
  "
  desc  'fix', "
    Configure the operating system to generate audit records when
successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the \"rename\" syscall occur.

    Add the following rules in \"/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules\":

    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S rename -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k delete

    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S rename -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k delete

    The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
